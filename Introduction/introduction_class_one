Introduction.

1.What is AngularJS.

2.What Are the Advantages of AngularJS.

3.What Are the Disadvantages of AngularJS.

4.Key Features Of AngularJS.

5.Differences Between  AngularJS  -  Angular2

                       AngularJS  - reactJS

                       AngularJS  - NodeJS


AngularJS.

    - AngularJS is a Client Side Java Script MVC Framework

        M - Model  (JavaScript Variables)

        V - View   (HTML / HTML5).

        C - Controller (JavaScript Functions).


Library & Framework ?

       - As a Developer we must call library to develop software Application.

       Ex.

                jQuery.


        - Framework will call our Application.

           Framework will call our Application , when ever we follow the Rules and Regulations

           otherwise Framework Won't Call Our Application.

           Ex.

                AngularJS

                reactJS

                d3JS

                    --
                    --
                    --

- AngularJS Have a So Many Predefined Modules, As a Angular Developer we can use the Predefined Modules.


Ex.

    ngRoute

    ngAnimate

    ngMessages

    ui.router   (3rd party Module)

    ngStorage


[Module . Collection of Implemetation of Classes & Interfaces ]


ngAnimate.

    used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.


ngMessages.

    used to perform the client side form validations.


ngStorage.

    used to work with the Storages

            1.localStorage

            2.sessionStorage


ngRoute.

    used to implement the Routing in Single Page Application.

    ngRoute Module is the Native Module.

    now a days no body using ngRoute Module because of It's Limitations.


           Limitations.

                    1. it won't Supports JSON.

                    2. it won't Supports Nested Routing.

                    3.It won't Supports Named Views


ui.router.

    - used to Implement the Routing in Single Page Applications.

    - Now a days almost all the projects they are using ui.router Module because of it's Advantages.


Ex.

    //Implement the Angular Application with the

        1. Animations Supports

        2. SPA (ui.router)

        3. Storages

        4. Validations

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html ng-app="app">

    //Implement the Animations

    //Implement the SPA (ui.router)

    //Implement the Storages

    //Implement the Validations


    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
            angular.module("app" , ["ngAnimate" , "ui.router", "ngStorage" , "ngMessages"]);
    </script>

</html>


- ng-app directive called as root directive for Angular Application
- Angular Framework starts the execution from ng-app directive
- ng-app directive used to assign the logical name for the Web Application.
- "angular" is the predefined class in angular framework.
- "module"  function used to add the Required Modules to Angular Application Development.
-  we must load all the script files at the end of HTML

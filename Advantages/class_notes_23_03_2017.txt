Advantages Of AngularJS.

1.We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

 DOM Stands for Document Object Model.

Ex 1.

  Copy the Data From One Division to Another Div by using HTML & JavaScript.

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<div id="div_one">Hello</div>
	<div id="div_two"></div>
	<script>
		document.getElementByid("div_two").innerHTML = 
		document.getElementBYid("div_one").value;
	</script>
</html>

[Note . We Can work with the HTML DOM By using JavaScript ] 


Ex 2.

	Copy the Data From One Div to Another Div By using AngularJS.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">
	<div ng-model="model_one">Hello</div>
	<div ng-bind="model_one"></div>
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

	- We Can Copy the Data From One Div to Another Div without depending on JavaScript.

	- we Can work with the HTML DOM by using Angular Directives.

		1.ng-app

		2.ng-model

		3.ng-bind

	- Angular Framework starts the Execution from ng-app directive.

	- ng-model directive internally creates the Object with the Element Data.
	 
	- ng-bind directives binds the model data to the HTML Output Elements.

2.AngularJS Supports the Two Way Data Binding.

	TwoWay DataBinding.

		Automatic Data Syncronization Between Model and View

		with the super vision of controller called as 

		Two Way Data Binding.


In the Above Diagram we have 3 server calls.

1.Fetch Request   (http get request)

2.Delete Request  (http post request)

3.Sync Request    (Ajax Server Call)


Fetch Request.

	this call used to fetch the data from server to the View.


Delete Request.

	this call used to delete the data from DataBase with the 
	
	post parameters.


Sync Request.

	this call used to sync the Data Between DataBase and View.


[Note.

	if we are programming languages developers we must make all the 

	3 server calls to meet our project requirement ]

	
[ Note .

	we can make only 2 server calls to meet above project requirement

	with the two way data binding in AngularJS. ]


[Note.

	Two Way data binding reduces the burden on the server ]
